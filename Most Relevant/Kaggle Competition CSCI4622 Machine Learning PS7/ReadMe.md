This assignment was a Kaggle competition where we were given a data set XTrain.csv and XTest.csv and were asked to create a model to predict values of YTrain.csv. We were not given Y test so we used YTest_Zeros.csv to generate our prediction output in submission.csv. I created the model in PS7.R.  I received a 118% on the assignment, 100% for achieving an R^2 of over 0.5 on Y test, 10% bonus for being in the top 25% of the Kaggle leaderboard and 8% bonus for achieving an R^2 8 percentage points above above 0.5 on Y test. Out of 49 participants I placed 6th. The Kaggle competition and description can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/t/b93db02bd14b4077892a7d09846add2d.
