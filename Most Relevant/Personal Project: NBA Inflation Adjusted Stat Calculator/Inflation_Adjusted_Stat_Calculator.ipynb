    "# NBA Inflation Adjusted Per 75 Possessions Stat Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will allow you to calculate Inflation Adjusted Per 75 Possessions, or IA /75, stats for any NBA player since the 1973-74 season. These are very useful stats for comparing NBA players across eras because they account for the sometimes very significant differences in pace and leaguewide volumes of stats over the years. It will tabulate a player's IA Points/75, IA Rebounds/75, IA Assists/75, IA Steals/75, IA Blocks/75, IA Turnovers/75, and relative true shooting percentage (a measure of era adjusted scoring efficiency), for each season in a specified range of seasons, as well as each of these stats over the entire range. In addition, I introduce a slightly modified version of Inflation Adjusted Per 75 Possessions stats known as Inflation and Pace Adjusted Per Game, or IPAPG, stats, which can be calculated for the same range of seasons and statistical categories. IPAPG stats are more useful that IA /75 stats in some insances because IPAPG stats tend to have higher values for players that play more minutes as per game stats do. More details about IPAPG stats are available towards the bottom of the notebook.\n",

    "To run this notebook, you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Player total stats table from basketball-reference.com (as csv file)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Player per 100 possessions stats table from basketball-reference.com (as csv file)\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain these files, you can go to a player's basketball reference page, go to the table you need (Totals and Per 100 Possessions), click \"Share & Export\" above the table, and click \"Get table as CSV (For Excel)\". In the \"Data\" folder of this Git repository, I have included some example player data. The files of the format \"firstname_lastname.csv\" are the total stats for a given player and the ones of the format \"firstname_lastname_per100.csv\" are the per 100 possessions stats for a given player. I included the data for approximately 10-15 of the greatest players of all time (since the 1973-74 season) at each position. If the player you want to calculate stats for is/was an all time great, I would reccommend taking a look there to see if I included him so you don't have to grab the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run all the cells in this notebook, it will first prompt you to upload these two files for your player of choice (first total stats then per 100 possessions stats), then it will prompt you to choose a start and end year in which to calculate the stats and the year you wish to adjust to (the present year is most commonly used), and finally it will display a series of tables and text outputs which are, in order, the team's possessions per game in each season in the range, the inflation adjustment factor for each stat in each season in the range, the IA /75 stats for each season in the range, the total IA /75 stats and cumulative infaltion adjusted stats for all seasons in the range, the IPAPG stats for each season in the range, and the total IPAPG stats and cumulative infaltion adjusted stats for all seasons in the range. Happy calculating!"

    "## **Inflation and Pace Adjusted Per Game (IPAPG) Stats Intro**\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional thing I wanted to do is calculate another version of these stats that don't hold minutes constant for different players. You see, inflation adjusted per 75 stats are considered the gold standard for comparing players across eras because they adjust for differences in team pace and era, but they also effectively adjust for the number of minutes per game a player plays. This can be useful in some circumstances, but there are some drawbacks. For example, a player playing 12 minutes per game may be productive in his role, but would not be able to scale up his production, so he wouldn't be nearly as valuable as a star player with the same inflation adjusted per 75 stats who plays 36 minutes per game. To account for this, I wanted to create a version of inflation adjusted per 75 stats that are multiplied by a player's minutes per game and divided by 36 (standard star minutes that roughly align with 75 possessions). This will result in stats that adjust for the team's pace and the league average of the given stat in the given year, but will reward players who play more minutes per game, as per game stats do. These stats will roughly align with per game stats just with pace and inflation adjustments. Thus, I call them Inflation and Pace Adjusted Per Game stats, or IPAPG stats.\n",
