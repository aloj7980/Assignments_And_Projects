This is a project I completed individually that explores the prediction of heart disease using logistic regression in R for STAT3400 Applied Regression which I took in the Spring 2023 semester. Project Paper 1 is an exploratory analysis of the variables in the data set. Project Paper 2 includes further analysis of the variables, development of the logistic regression model, and analysis of the model. Note that the heart.csv file contains the data filtered for outliers deemed unreasonable so if you try to run the Project Paper 1 rmd file you will not get the same plots as they are in the pdf.
