This is a course project I completed with two other students for APPM4600 Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing in the Fall 2023 Semester. We explored the mathematical formulation and numerical results from function approximations with noisy data using different regularized least squares models. Only the final report is included here, all other files can be found in the 'APPM4600 Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing' folder.
