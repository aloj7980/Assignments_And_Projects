These are the assignments and projects I've completed most relevant to data science and machine learning. They demonstrate my abilities in R, SQL and Python, possibly the three most important languages for a data scientist, and explore a variety of concepts. I encourage you to explore more of my assignments and projects but these are the few that I think are most important to explore if time is a factor.
