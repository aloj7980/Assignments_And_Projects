This is a course project I completed with two other students for CSCI4502 Data Mining in the Fall 2023 semester. We created a model to predict salaries for data science related jobs using a data set from Kaggle merged with US Census population data. Much of the time spent on this project was on the feature engineering techniques which were used to capture the importance of several text features, many of them with hundreds of unique values, in a single numeric feature. These techniques resulted in the most accurate models of the ones that we created, some of which were more accurate than all of those of an existing paper which created salary prediction models using the same initial data set. Details about these techniques can be found in the 'Feature Engineering' subsection of the 'Methodology' section. Only the final report is included here, see the 'CSCI4502 Data Mining' folder for all data and code used.
