## Alex Ojemann's Assignments and Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my assignments and projects portfolio. In this repository I showcase the assignments and projects I have been a part of that are relevant to the employment opportunities I'm seeking. Each folder within this repository other than the "Most Relevant" folder contains all of my assignments, projects, and other relevant materials from a given course at CU Boulder or University of Minnesota or a project I completed independently. If you're looking for just a few examples that demonstrate my knowledge of data science and machine learning well, see the "Most Relevant" folder. Not all relevant courses are included here because some had assignments and projects that aren't recoverable. Exams are not included here.
