## Alex Ojemann's Assignments and Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my assignments and projects portfolio. In this repository I showcase the assignments and projects I have been a part of that are relevant to the employment opportunities I'm seeking. Each folder within this repository contains all of my assignments, projects, and other relevant materials from a given course at CU Boulder or University of Minnesota or a project I completed independently. Courses with a course number below 5000 are undergraduate courses that I took at CU Boulder and those with a course number of 5000 or above are graduate courses that I took at the University of Minnesota. If you're looking for just a few examples that demonstrate my knowledge of data science and machine learning well, see the "Most Relevant" folder. Not all relevant courses are included here because some had assignments and projects that aren't recoverable. Exams are not included here.
