This assignment was a kaggle competition where we were given a data set X_train and X_test and were asked to create a model to predict values of y_train. We were not given y_test so we used YTest_Zeros.csv to generate our prediction output. I received a 111% on the assignment, 100% for achieving an R^2 of over 0.5 on Y test, 10% bonus for being in the top 25% of the Kaggle leaderboard and 8% bonus for achieving an R^2 0.08 above 0.5 on Y test. I created the model in PS7.R and the Kaggle competition and description can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/t/b93db02bd14b4077892a7d09846add2d.
