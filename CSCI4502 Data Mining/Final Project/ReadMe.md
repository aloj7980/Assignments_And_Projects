For this project, two other students and I explored salary prediction using a relatively small data set from Kaggle. We experimented with different feature transformations to avoid thousands of unique dummy variables that would occur if all categorical columns were to be one hot encoded and compared a few different models to each other and to models generated by others using the same data set.
