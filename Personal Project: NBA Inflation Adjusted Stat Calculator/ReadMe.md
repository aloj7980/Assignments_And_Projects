# NBA Inflation Adjusted Per 75 Possessions Stat Calculator

This is a personal project I worked on outside of class in the Summer of 2024. The end product contains clear descriptions of all steps and is designed to be easy to use even for those not familiar with inflation adjusted NBA stats, so I encourage you to test it out if you're curious.

This Jupyter Notebbok will allow you to calculate Inflation Adjusted Per 75 Possessions, or IA /75, stats for any NBA player since the 1973-74 season. These are very useful stats for comparing players across eras because they account for the sometimes very significant differences in pace and leaguewide volumes of stats over the years. It will tabulate a player's IA Points/75, IA Rebounds/75, IA Assists/75, IA Steals/75, IA Blocks/75, IA Turnovers/75, and relative true shooting percentage (a measure of era adjusted scoring efficiency), for each season in a specified range of seasons, as well as each of these stats over the entire range. In addition, I introduce a slightly modified version of Inflation Adjusted Per 75 Possessions stats known as Inflation and Pace Adjusted Per Game, or IPAPG, stats, which can be calculated for the same range of seasons and statistical categories. IPAPG stats are more useful that IA /75 stats in some insances because IPAPG stats tend to have higher values for players that play more minutes as per game stats do. More details about IPAPG stats are available towards the bottom of the notebook.
