This project explores the prediction of NBA player salaries using player stats from Basketball Reference. The data was cleaned and transformed as needed. Player stats were adjusted for differences in era and player salaries were adjusted for the league salary cap. The only regression model taught in this class was linear regression and I had learned about decision trees on my own so those were the models I used. See FinalReport_Predicting_NBA_Player_Salaries_with_Stats.pdf for more information.
